Got it. Here’s the simple-execution SOP with the exact shortcut keys from your setup so Perplexity can follow it precisely.

TopstepX Simple Execution Shortcuts (with keys)

Scope and safety
- Scope: Hotkeys act on the active symbol/panel.
- Safety: Avoid OCO/brackets. Use Market or Join Bid/Ask. Keep Flatten/Flatten All as deliberate combos.

Core actions and keys
- Buy Market: Alt + B
- Sell Market: Alt + S
- Join Bid: Alt + N
- Join Ask: Alt + D
- Reverse Position: Alt + T
- Close Position (flatten current symbol): Alt + C
- Cancel All (working orders on current symbol): Alt + F
- Flatten All (emergency all symbols): Alt + G
- Hide Vol. Profile Column: Alt + H
- Center on Last Price: Alt + ArrowUp
- Contract Size +1: Alt + ArrowDown
- Break Even: Alt + B + E

Entry protocol
- Default entry: Alt + B (long) or Alt + S (short).
- Price improvement attempt: Alt + N (Join Bid for long) or Alt + D (Join Ask for short).
  - If not filled quickly: Alt + F (Cancel All), then Alt + B or Alt + S to enter via Market.
- Protection (no OCO): After entry, place one manual Stop Market only if needed.

Exit protocol
- Fast exit: Alt + C (Close Position). If UI lags, press the opposite Market key (Alt + S to exit long, Alt + B to cover short).
- If using Join Bid/Ask to exit and price moves away: Alt + F (Cancel All), then Alt + C or opposite Market.
- After any exit: Alt + F (Cancel All) to clear leftovers.

Emergency and recovery
- Panic flatten across symbols: Alt + G (Flatten All), then verify positions are flat.
- Accidental reverse: Alt + T reverses; avoid pressing unless intentional.

Muscle-memory drills
- Drill 1: Flat → Alt + B → Alt + C → Alt + F.
- Drill 2: Flat → Alt + N (no fill) → Alt + F → Alt + B → Alt + C → Alt + F.
- Drill 3: In position → Alt + D (target) → price moves away → Alt + F → Alt + C.
- Drill 4: In position with manual stop working → Alt + C → Alt + F.

Operating rules
- When unsure, choose certainty: Market (Alt + B / Alt + S).
- Join Bid/Ask must fill fast; otherwise Cancel All (Alt + F) and go Market.
- Do not use OCO/brackets in choppy platform conditions.
- Keep Flatten All (Alt + G) as last resort; verify flat afterward.

If you change any bindings later, send the updated keys and I’ll regenerate this SOP with the new combos.

# **Complete Algorithmic Day Trading System: Expanded Technical Analysis Framework**


## **Section 1 — System Overview**


This algorithm is engineered for **intraday trading** with the capability to:
- **Scalp** short-term momentum bursts (20 seconds to 5 minutes)
- **Build positions** throughout the day into longer intraday swings (10–180 minutes)
- **Adapt dynamically** to changing market volatility
- **Enforce strict institutional-grade risk controls**


It utilizes **multi-timeframe analysis (MTA)** across **two time-based** (15m, 1h) and **two event-based** (500-tick candlestick, 500-tick Renko) charts.  
Indicators are layered in a way that higher timeframe structure dictates trade bias, and lower timeframe price/volume signatures refine entries.

## **Section 2 — Timeframe Role Hierarchy**


### **1-Hour Candlestick Chart (HTF Bias & Macro Intraday Map)**
- **Purpose**: Determine primary trade direction and trend strength.
- **Indicators Used**: VWAP, 50MA, 200DMA, Bollinger Bands (+2/+3 σ), RSI(14).
- **Actions on This Timeframe**:
  - Directional bias determined: Only long trades if price > VWAP and MA structure is bullish; only short trades if below VWAP and structure is bearish.
  - Identify key swing highs/lows for daily support/resistance.
  - Confirm Bollinger Band compression for potential high-volatility breakouts.


### **15-Minute Candlestick Chart (Setup Locator)**
- **Purpose**: Identify tactical pullback zones, consolidation patterns, bullish/bearish flags.
- **Indicators Used**: VWAP, 21MA, 50MA, Bollinger Bands, RSI(14), ATR(14), Volume.
- **Actions on This Timeframe**:
  - Wait for price to approach moving average confluence zones aligned with higher timeframe bias.
  - Reject trades if RSI divergence against higher timeframe direction is present.


### **500-Tick Candlestick Chart (Entry Precision & Micro-Structure)**
- **Purpose**: Detect real-time order flow changes, micro breakouts, and early reversals.
- **Indicators Used**: VWAP intraday reset, 21MA, Bollinger Bands (2σ), Volume Surge Filter.
- **Actions on This Timeframe**:
  - Use break of micro structure with 1.5–2× average volume as a trigger.
  - Recognize fakeouts via volume divergence signals.


### **500-Tick Renko Chart (Noise Removal Trend Visualizer)**
- **Purpose**: Strip out intrabar noise and focus purely on sustained directional moves.
- **Indicators Used**: None on Renko bricks themselves except optional overlay of VWAP and key moving averages for context.
- **Actions on This Timeframe**:
  - Only trade in the same direction as Renko trend bricks aligned with higher timeframes.
  - Use first brick change after micro reversal patterns for scalp entries.

## **Section 3 — Indicator Implementation Rules**


### **VWAP**
- **Resets daily at market open (09:30 ET)**.
- Acts as **primary directional filter** — no counter-VWAP trades unless scalping extreme reversion signals.
- **Pullback rules**:
  - Bullish: Enter on pullback to VWAP from above with proof of rejection.
  - Bearish: Enter on pullback to VWAP from below with rejection.


### **Bollinger Bands**
- **Standard Bands**: 20-period, ±2σ for ongoing volatility tracking.
- **Extreme Bands**: 20-period, ±3σ for rare statistical extremes — used as high-confidence reversal trigger zones.
- **Breakout Setup**: BB squeeze detection (low bandwidth); enter on confirmed breakout in direction of higher timeframe bias with volume > 1.5× average.


### **Moving Averages**
- **21 EMA**: Short-term price slope guide and active pullback level.
- **50 SMA**: Mid-term bias confirmer.
- **200 DMA**: Macro intraday swing direction.
- **480 MA**: Ultra-long reference (aligns with 20-day hourly trend).
- **Bullish Stack**: 21 > 50 > 200 > 480
- **Bearish Stack**: 21 < 50 < 200 < 480
- **Flat**: No stack; bias only from VWAP and volume analysis.


### **RSI**
- Standard: RSI(14).
- Adjust thresholds for trending markets:
  - Bullish: Oversold at 40 not 30; overbought at 80.
  - Bearish: Overbought at 60 not 70; oversold at 20.
- Divergence in direction opposite to setup = caution or reduced size.


### **Volume**
- Compare real-time volume to 50-period average on each chart.
- **Breakout condition**: >150% average volume on trigger candle.
- **Volume Divergence**: Breakouts on <100% average volume = breakout fade candidate.


### **ATR**
- ATR(14) on trade execution chart.
- Stop = 1.5x ATR for scalp, 2x ATR for day trade.
- Position sizing tied to volatility: higher ATR = smaller size.

## **Section 4 — Confluence Scoring System**


| Factor                                 | Points |
|----------------------------------------|--------|
| Higher timeframe VWAP bias match       | 2      |
| Bollinger Band location & expansion    | 2      |
| MA stack alignment                     | 3      |
| RSI in favorable zone                  | 1      |
| Volume confirmation > 120% avg         | 2      |
| ATR > 80% of average                   | 1      |
| All 4 timeframes trend aligned         | 3      |
| HTF support/resistance agreement       | 2      |
**Max Score: 16**


- 14–16: Full size (2–3% risk)  
- 11–13: Standard size (1–2% risk)  
- 8–10: Reduced size (0.5–1% risk)  
- 5–7: Scalp only  
- <5: No trade

## **Section 5 — Entry & Exit Rules**


### **Long Entry**

2. **Setup (15m)**: Pullback to 21 or 50MA with RSI > 50.
3. **Trigger (500-tick)**: Micro-structure breakout with volume surge ≥ 1.5×.
4. **Trend Confirmation (Renko)**: Green bricks.
5. Confluence score ≥ 8.


### **Short Entry**
Exactly inverse of long.

## **Section 6 — Position Management**


- **Scaling In**: 25% initial size, +25% on 500-tick confirmation, +50% when Renko trend resumes in your favor.
- **Scaling Out**: Remove 50% at 1R, trail stop with Parabolic SAR or last swing low/high.
- **Stop-Loss**: Always ATR-based; never static pips/ticks.


***


## **Section 7 — Market Regime Switch**


- **High Volatility (ATR > 1.2× 20-day avg)**: Favor breakouts, reduce size 25%.
- **Low Volatility (ATR < 0.8×)**: Favor mean reversion, increase size 25%.
- **Trending**: Ignore standard RSI OB/OS — use pullback RSI levels.
- **Ranging**: VWAP & Bollinger fade plays only.


***


## **Section 8 — Risk & Controls**

## **Section 9 — Operational Flow**


1. **Pre-Market (08:30–09:30 ET)**:

   - Mark HTF support/resistance zones.


2. **Open Session (09:30–10:30)**:
   - Observe opening drive; avoid trades in first 2m unless extreme setup.


3. **Mid-Day (10:30–14:00)**:
   - Focus on breakouts from consolidations and VWAP reclaims.


4. **Late Day (14:00–15:45)**:
   - Exit all intraday positions entirely.
   - Avoid fresh trades unless liquidity + volatility spike.

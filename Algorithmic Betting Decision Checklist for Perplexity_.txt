Algorithmic Betting Decision Checklist for Perplexity
=====================================================


1. Pre-Trade Preparation  
- Set bankroll and define risk parameters (per bet, daily, weekly caps).  
- Note relevant market types (Kalshi, sportsbook, binary contracts, etc.).


2. Systematic Data Collection (Browser-Based)  
- Every 4 hours, or on major event triggers:  
    - Search:  
        - “[Event] odds Kalshi”  
        - “[Team/Player] betting line movement”  
        - “X sentiment [Event]”  
    - Browse high-impact posts and engagement spikes on X.  
    - Record sportsbook and Kalshi contract prices.  
    - Note volume/liquidity available.


3. Implied Probability & Vig Removal  
- Convert odds to implied probabilities:  
    - Decimal: IP = 1 / Decimal_Odds  
    - American: +X → IP = 100 / (100 + X), –X → IP = X / (100 + X)  
- Sum IPs and normalize: NP_i = IP_i / S, where S = sum of IP_i.  
- For Kalshi, adjust for fee: True_Prob = (Price – 0.01) / (1 – 0.02).


4. Statistical Model Blending  
- Model prediction using logistic regression or random forest.  
- Include social sentiment and historical outcomes.  
- Blend probabilities:  
    - 30% sportsbook  
    - 25% Kalshi  
    - 20% model prediction  
    - 15% sentiment  
    - 10% historical outcomes  
- Final_Prob = weighted sum.


5. Edge Detection & Opportunity Scan  
- Calculate Edge = Final_Prob – NP.  
- Flag if Edge > 2% and sufficient liquidity.  
- Compare probabilities across markets for arbitrage (NP_max – NP_min > fees/spread).  
- If sentiment spike and price unchanged, temporarily boost Final_Prob.


6. Trade Confidence & Decision Logic  
- Proceed only if all are true:  
    - Edge > 2%  
    - Confidence > 60%  
    - (Final_Prob × Odds – 1 > 0)  
- If not met, skip event and document reason.


7. Position Sizing  
- Kelly Criterion:  
    - b = (Payout / Stake) – 1  
    - Full Kelly: f* = (b × p – q) / b (p = Final_Prob, q = 1 – p)  
    - Fractional: f* × 0.30  
- Limit bet to ≤ 5% of bankroll; follow daily/weekly/correlation caps.


8. Execution & Logging  
- Place bet and log: queries, odds, IP, NP, Final_Prob, Edge, Kelly size, outcome logic.  
- Note timestamp and rationale.


9. Real-Time Monitoring & Exit Management  
- Every 15 minutes or when relevant news hits:  
    - Recalculate NP and Final_Prob.  
    - Exit if: profit falls >50%, sentiment reverses, or Edge < 0.  
    - Target exit at 80% of theoretical max gain.  
    - Stop-loss at 50% of initial EV.


10. Performance Tracking & Improvement  
- After each event: record P&L and Closing Line Value.  
- Weekly: adjust weights based on accuracy.  
- Monthly: retrain statistical models.  
- Tune Edge and sentiment thresholds for optimal ROI.

If you want, I can also **condense this into a one-page “rapid execution” command sheet** so you can run bets in under two minutes per decision cycle. Would you like me to do that?
